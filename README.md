# 👋 Hey there! I'm @JohnyDevv

<section id="about-me">
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <h1 align="center">Hi, I'm John</h1>
    <p align="center">
      I'm a beginner-friendly developer, currently diving into the world of web development.  
      Mostly focused on frontend, but slowly exploring the backend side too.  
      I enjoy learning new things, building small projects, and breaking things (intentionally or not 😅).  
      I'm far from perfect, but I'm trying my best — so I kindly ask for your patience 🙏
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      Always curious, always experimenting.  
      Just trying to grow as a developer — one bugfix at a time.
    </p>
